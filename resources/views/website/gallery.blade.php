            <br>

            <p>
                It is Prantika, where you can also exchange your marvellous thoughts with them. Visitors have the opportunity to interact with students,

            <h4 class="text-uppercase">BONOBIBI PALA- THE SACRED TALE OF THE MANGROVES</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Deep in the heart of the Sundarbans, where the wilderness whispers ancient tales, the legend of Bonobibi lives on through the vibrant folk performance of Bonobibi Pala.
                This traditional narrative play, deeply rooted in the cultural fabric of the region, tells the tale of Bonobibi, the revered guardian of the forest,
                who protects the inhabitants from the wrath of Dakkhin Rai, the tiger deity. The performance is a mesmerizing blend of storytelling, music, and rhythmic dance,
                bringing to life the eternal struggle between good and evil.
            </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    As the drums echo through the night and the chants fill the air, the people of the Sundarbans express their faith, gratitude, and resilience through this sacred tradition.
                    Visitors at Prantika can witness this captivating performance, immersing themselves in the spiritual and cultural essence of the region.
                    Bonobibi Pala is not just a play- it is a testament to the deep bond between humans and nature, a story passed down through generations,
                    ensuring that the spirits of the forest remain alive in the hearts of those who call the Sundarbans home.

                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">FOREST WALK - A JOURNEY THROUGH THE GREEN VEIL</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Step into the heart of the Sundarbans on an immersive forest walk, where every footstep tells a story and every rustling leaf whispers the secrets of the wild.
                Guided by expert naturalists, this experience offers an up-close encounter with the untouched beauty of the mangrove ecosystem. As you tread softly through winding trails,
                the air is thick with the scent of salt and earth, and the calls of exotic birds echo through the dense canopy. </p>
            </br>

            <p>The forest walk is not just an adventure; it is an opportunity to witness the delicate balance of nature firsthand.
                From spotting rare medicinal plants to learning about the intricate root systems that hold the land together,
                every moment is a lesson in resilience and survival. With a chance to see deer grazing in the shadows, crabs scuttling beneath the mangrove roots,
                and perhaps even the watchful eyes of a crocodile lurking in the waterways, this journey into the wilderness is a true testament to the magic of the Sundarbans. </p>
